<h2>Activity Overview</h2>

In this activity, you will showcase your ability to use Python to build a multiple linear regression (MLR) model. You will also update team members and stakeholders through an executive summary, demonstrating your ability to organize and communicate key information. 

<h3>Scenario</h3>

You are a member of the TikTok data analytics team. The team is currently more than halfway through the claims classification project. Earlier, you completed a project proposal, used Python to explore and analyze the claims classification dataset, created data visualizations, and conducted a hypothesis  test. 

The TikTok team has reviewed the results of the hypothesis testing. TikTok’s Operations Lead, Maika Abadi, is interested in how different variables are associated with whether a user is verified. Earlier, the data team observed that if a user is verified, they are much more likely to post opinions. Now, the data team has decided to explore how to predict verified status to help them understand how video characteristics relate to verified users. Therefore, you have been asked to conduct a logistic regression using verified status as the outcome variable. The results may be used to inform the final model related to predicting whether a video is a claim vs an opinion.

You check your inbox and discover a new email from Maika Abadi asking the data team about the details of a regression model. You also notice two follow-up emails from Rosie Mae. The first lists the specific variables that should be analyzed in the logistic regression model. The second email asks you to help build the model and prepare an executive summary to share your results.

Hello Data Team,

I really appreciate your work, and thanks for the explanation of the next phase of the data analysis.

I’m curious to know more about how different variables are associated with whether a user is verified. I was hoping to get a bit more detail on the regression your team is planning to conduct. Will you be applying a linear regression model or a logistic regression model? It wasn’t clear in the meeting, and I wanted to be sure our teams are aligned on expectations. 

Thank you, 

Maika Abadi

Thank you for your email. 

Apologies that it was not clear in the meeting. 

To answer your question, we’ve decided to look into how to predict ‘verified_status’, which we believe will help us understand how video characteristics relate to verified users. To achieve this, the data team will build a logistic regression model using ‘verified_status’ as the outcome variable. The results of this milestone will inform us as we approach constructing the final claims prediction model.

Feel free to reach out with additional questions. 

Many thanks,

Hello my Data team! 

Would you two mind completing the following using the fictional test data set:: 

Logistic regression model in a Python notebook based ‘verified_status’ variable in the claims classification dataset

Be sure to include a confusion matrix of the results and the accuracy score of the model

 Draft an executive summary of your results

I’d appreciate a chance to look it over before you send it over to Mary Joanna. Please write the summary as if you’re addressing the leadership team. 

Best regards,

Rosie Mae Bradshaw
