<h2>Activity Overview</h2>

In this activity, you will showcase your ability to use statistical methods to analyze and interpret data. In particular, you will use descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing. You will also update team members through an executive summary, demonstrating your ability to organize and communicate key information. 

<h3>Scenario</h3>

The TikTok data analytics team has completed the first three milestones of the claims classification project and is nearing the halfway point. So far, the team has completed a project proposal, and used Python to perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset for the claims classification project. The team also produced data visualizations in both Python and Tableau to share with stakeholders. The next step is to use statistical methods to analyze and interpret the claims classification data. 

You receive a new email from Mary Joanna Rodgers, one of TikTok’s project management officers. Mary Joanna informs the data team about a new request: to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in the number of views for TikTok videos posted by verified accounts versus unverified accounts. You also receive follow-up emails from Data Science Manager, Rosie Mae Bradshaw and Data Science Lead, Willow Jaffey. These emails share the details of the analysis. A final email from Data Scientist, Orion Rainier, details your next assignment: to conduct a hypothesis test on verified versus unverified accounts in terms of video view count.

Hello Data Team! 

Really excellent work so far. The leadership team is impressed with the results–especially the progress and insights shared on the last executive summary report! Thanks so much for the hard work. 

On that note, they have requested an additional item to be added to the initial project scope. We are interested in whether there is a statistical difference in the data between verified and unverified accounts. Do you have any indication which variable would be most insightful to test in terms of verified and unverified accounts? 

Many thanks!

Thanks for the update, Mary Joanna.

It’s great to hear that the leadership team is pleased with the data team’s progress and the early insights we have been able to deliver. I never grow tired of being reminded of what a great data team we have assembled here at TikTok!

If you would, please tell them we will be providing this analysis in two weeks time. 

@Orion, my initial thought is for us to conduct a hypothesis test to analyze whether there is a significant difference in video views for verified versus unverified accounts. What do you think? 

In summary, I think we should do the following: 

Compute descriptive statistics on the claims classification data

Conduct a two-sample hypothesis test of verified versus unverified accounts in terms of video view counts

Thanks,

Hi all, 

@Rosie Mae, I agree with you on statistical testing. We’ll share a summary of the results before we present it to the client. 

We’ll get started right away. 

Thank you,

Hi there, fellow data professional! 

You’ve been handling all of this work really well, by the way. Excellent job. 

I was wondering if you’d like to try the statistical testing yourself? Based on what you’ve shared with me, I have every confidence you already have all the skills and experience needed for this task. 

What do you think? Would you like to try? 

Also, like I said in my email to Rosie Mae, you’ll need to write an executive summary of the results so we can present it to Willow before sharing it with the client. 

Thanks so much!
