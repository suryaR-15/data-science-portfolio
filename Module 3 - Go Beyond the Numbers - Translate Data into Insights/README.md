<h2>Activity Overview</h2>

In this activity, you will demonstrate your ability to organize, present, and share the stories within data. You will also update team members through an executive summary, demonstrating your ability to organize and communicate key information.  

<h3>Scenario</h3>

Your team is still in the early stages of their latest project. So far, you’ve completed a project proposal and used Python to inspect and organize the TikTok dataset.

You check your inbox and notice a new message from Orion Rainier, a Data Scientist at TikTok. Orion is pleased with the work you have already completed and is requesting your assistance with some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization. You also notice a follow-up email from the Data Science Lead, Willow Jaffey. Willow suggests including an executive summary of your analysis to share with teammates.

Hi there,

Thanks for the amazing work you’ve done so far. 

We’re ready to perform EDA on the data. Has Rosie Mae told you what the management team expects when it comes to EDA? If not, think of it as a “show your work” kind of report. They will want to see a Python notebook showing the structuring and cleaning you did, as well as any matplotlib/seaborn visualizations you plotted to help us understand the data. I would suggest at the very least a graph comparing claim counts to opinion counts, as well as boxplots of the most important variables (like “video duration,” “video like count,” “video comment count,” and “video view count”) to check for outliers. Also a breakdown of “author ban status” counts. But whatever you think makes most sense works for us. 

Additionally, the management team has recently asked all EDA to include Tableau visualizations. We’ve found these to be particularly helpful in status reports to the client and board members. For this data, I suggest a Tableau dashboard showing a simple claims versus opinions count, as well as stacked bar charts of claims versus opinions for variables like video view counts, video like counts, video share counts, and video download counts. Make sure it is easy to understand to someone who isn’t data savvy, and remember that the assistant director is a person with visual impairments. I understand you have some Tableau experience? Let me know if you need help with this. 

By the way, I CC’d our Data Science Lead, Willow Jaffey, who is on the senior management team and will be reviewing and approving our analysis before the project manager reports it back to the client. @Willow, I just want to keep you informed on the progress! 

Thanks!

Thank you, Orion!

Welcome to the team, so glad to have you. 

Along with the Tableau dashboard and notebook, it would be really helpful if you included an executive summary of your analysis attached via email. 

Appreciate your help!
